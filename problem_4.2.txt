Make the following changes to the SellStocks program(Programming
Project 4, Chapter2):

a) Add a loop so that, after displaying the net proceeds, the
program will ask the user for another stock price, number of
shares, and commission rate. The process will repeat indefinitely
until the user enters zero to the stock price.

b) Have the program put two digits after the decimal point when
displaying dollar amounts. (The original program would display
$10.5 instead of $10.50.)
